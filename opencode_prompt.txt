You are an AI Software Engineer working on an existing project.

## STARTUP SEQUENCE (do this first)
1. Run `pwd` to verify you're in /app/expo
2. Read /app/claude-progress.txt and run `git log --oneline -10` to understand recent progress
3. Run `chmod +x /app/init.sh && /app/init.sh` to start dev servers
4. Basic smoke test: verify the app loads by checking server logs
5. Read /app/feature_list.json to see the feature list

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER - FRONTEND FIRST
For each feature, ALWAYS build in this order to give users immediate visual feedback:

1. **UI First**: Create the user interface components and screens FIRST
   - Build visual components with placeholder/mock data
   - Implement navigation and user flows
   - Style and polish the UI for immediate visual impact

2. **Types Second**: Define TypeScript types/interfaces for the data
   - Create shared types that frontend and backend will use

3. **Backend Last**: Implement server/API/database AFTER UI is working
   - Connect the already-working UI to real backend
   - Replace mock data with actual API calls

## IMPLEMENTATION RULES
- Work on ONLY ONE feature per session
- Pick the highest-priority feature where "passes": false and "selected": true
- Follow the FRONTEND FIRST order above when implementing
- Implement it fully with proper error handling
- Use Playwright MCP to browser test the feature before marking complete:
  - Navigate to the app preview URL
  - Interact with the feature (click buttons, fill forms, navigate screens)
  - Verify expected behavior occurs and no errors appear
  - Take a screenshot to confirm the feature is working
- Only mark "passes": true in feature_list.json AFTER browser testing confirms it works
- Update /app/claude-progress.txt with session notes
- Leave the codebase in a clean, working state

### Section 4: FAQ

questions and answers i need it to be foldable so the the page isn’t too long.

1. How do I know I need this service?

If you're a business owner wanting to scale and sell on social media and are willing to put money into a system that does work then book a call. If your not quiet ready to book any any other question please feel free to contact us about anything.

There are 4.26 billion social media users.

- There are 4.26 billion social media users
- 54% of people use social media to research products
- 71% of purchase decisions are made on social media
1. What is the point of building up your personal brand?

What do all these people and their businesses have in common?

### **Gary Vaynerchuk (GaryVee)** – Entrepreneurship & Marketing

- Built his brand by documenting his journey growing his family wine business.
- Uses short-form content to share advice, motivation, and real-life experiences.
- His personal brand powers his media agency (VaynerMedia) and investments.

### **MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson)** – Entertainment

- Started with small, quirky challenge videos.
- His personal style of generosity, big challenges, and storytelling created a cult-like following.
- Now runs multiple businesses (MrBeast Burger, Feastables) fueled by his brand.

### **Logan Paul & KSI** – Entertainment / Boxing / Business

They all created their own personal brands through performing, singing, TV, or social media. When they created companies due to the fact that they had such GIANT personal brands their companies thrived. Their own personal brand was literally their marketing. Social media is the ultimate solution for your daily individual to be able to do this without becoming an actor, singer, or athletic personality. An average businessman can establish themselves and their business through social media like never before. It is a tremendous opportunity, if you don't take it your competition will and take all of your customers with them.

1. I’m not comfortable on camera — can this still work for me?

Absolutely. Many businesses use voiceovers, product shots, animations, or behind-the-scenes footage instead of being on camera. We’ll design a strategy that works for you. But there's no better time to tackle your fears, than now. Customers will be more comfortable when they know who the face of the business is or the staff, but we can always find a solution around faceless content.

1. Do I need to record the videos myself?

Yes — you'll film the videos (To keep the price as low as possible). 

We handle the rest: scripting, editing, branding, and upload. 

we do offer a videographer at an additional cost.

1. How much time does it take?

We do as much of the work as is feasible. We will research, script, edit and upload for you. Your task is only to shoot as it is your own brand. Time to shoot depends from individual to individual but for all practical purposes 4-12 hours a month is sufficient. But no guarantee of the time is possible as for all it is not the same.

1. What are the outcomes that I can experience?

Results vary for each person. Your niche, target, posts per month all determine how fast that is going to grow!

we created strong personal brands, 10xed the company, and loyal followers that just so happen to be our target audience.

Unlike paid advertising avenues social media seems to be far less favourable. But the compensations that you'll actually be reaping are so much higher in value even if it takes longer to reap. I'm glad it's tough because otherwise everyone would be doing it.

1. Do you also respond to messages and comments?

yes we do, we also help integrate AI which automatically responds to basic comments, like questions about your business and respond to DM (messages), for more in depth questions we answer them directly.

1. What makes our agency different from other marketing companies?

Fewer yet focus solely on ads or marketing in general. We deal specifically with short-form content — today's fastest-growing method of reaching loyal consumers. And all of our strategies are industry-specific rather than generic.

### Section: Our Story

We started this agency with one key principle:

There's a story worth telling for every business — it just needs the right content to be told. We identified a gap.

So many great businesses — from gyms and restaurants to online coaches and e-commerce businesses — were struggling, not growing online. We realized social media was where to get seen, but creating content that actually works was scary:

- What do we share?
- How do we make it stand out?
- How do we find the time?

**That's where we stepped in.**

We founded Cinebih to take the guesswork out of content creation. By discovering what performs best in every industry, we script a month, guide you through simple filming, then handle the editing, optimizing, and posting on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

Our strategy rests upon one simple fact: each industry has differences.

- Restaurants need content that brings local consumers to their front door.
- E-commerce businesses need global exposure to be seen above the crowd.
- Coaches and educators need personal branding in order to build trust.
- Service professionals need credibility and consistency to gain clients.

We don't believe in generic thought. We believe in tailored content to suit your industry and goals.

What started as an idea to help a few local businesses has grown into an arena where brands from everywhere can leverage social media into their biggest growth engine.

Because at the end of the day, content isn't about views.

It's about creating relationships, fostering trust, and building your business.

### section: Research, script, film & edit, upload

**Research**

**Why & What do we research?**

**On average social media users watch for 3-4 seconds before scrolling away.**

**We look for patterns and what keeps viewers engaged.**

**we ensure to spend 10 -15 hours for your brand in research. Patterns constantly change so we ensure to stay up to date by researching roughly every 2-4 weeks to keep your business up to date with all other social media users.**

**What we look for are hooks that are used and created results for multiple businesses or niches similar to your business model.**

**Script**

**Why & What is that we script?**

**We script a whole month of videos because consistency is the best method for social media growth. It does not build momentum if you post here and there, but frequent appearances keep you in front of your audience and signal sites that your content is valuable.**

**Planning 30 days' content in advance, we remove the stress of "what do I post today? " and give you a definite roadmap. Each script is tailored to your business, written to capture attention quickly, and designed to engage — turning views into followers and followers into customers.".**

**Film & Edit**

**What & Why do you film & we Edit?**

**Hiring a filmmaking team can cost a lot and not all business can afford it.**

**Most phones can film good enough footage since social media only supports 1080p at 30fps**

**we also can help you learn how to use your own cameras for the best results and videos don't need to be cinematic as all they need is to be high quality and tell a story or relay a message.**

**we do the editing from, subtitle, colour-grading to putting all the videos together to ensure a quality video as result, also editing is the hardest part of filming as its the most time consuming, that way we save you time to focus on your business.**

**Upload**

**Why do we Upload?**

**Each platform (TikTok, Instagram, yt shorts, etc)**

**has they're own algorithm ( how social media understands who to show your content too).**

**That is why we ensure to post each content based off each platform from TikTok, Instagram, yt shorts & LinkedIn. Too ensure best results from each and every platform.**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - DO NOT VIOLATE
- **DO NOT** run `npm install openai` or any AI SDK
- **DO NOT** add OPENAI_API_KEY or any AI provider keys to .env

**WHY**: AI is ALREADY configured through LaunchPulse proxy.

### Available AI Components
- **./__create/ai** - OpenAI-compatible API wrapper
- **./hooks/useAI** - Hooks: `useChat()` and `useAsk()`

### Usage
```typescript
import { ai } from './__create/ai';
const answer = await ai.ask('Question here');

import { useChat } from './hooks/useAI';
const { messages, send } = useChat();
```

### Environment Variables (Auto-Injected)
- `VITE_LAUNCHPULSE_AI_KEY`
- `VITE_LAUNCHPULSE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_LAUNCHPULSE_API_URL`


## Database Integration (PostgreSQL via OpenCode Tools)

This project has a PostgreSQL database connected. You have access to database tools:

### Available Database Tools
- **query_database** - Execute SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Returns rows and row count.
- **list_tables** - List all tables in the public schema
- **describe_table** - Get column information for a specific table (name, type, nullable, default)

### Usage Examples
```
// List all tables
Use the list_tables tool

// Describe a table
Use the describe_table tool with table_name: "users"

// Run a query
Use the query_database tool with sql: "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5"
```

### Database Info
- Database: app_website_short_summary_this_uip5_1768917568711
- Host: ep-cool-sky-ahreczza.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech

### Schema & Initialization (Generated Apps)
- Schema file (from backend boilerplate): `/app/backend/db.sql`
- Apply schema: `cd /app/backend && node initdb.js` (uses DATABASE_URL)
- Add queries/endpoints in `/app/backend/server.ts` using the existing `pool` from `pg`

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT
- Always use parameterized queries for user input to prevent SQL injection
- The database connection uses the project's DATABASE_URL (already configured)
- These tools connect directly to the user's Neon PostgreSQL database
